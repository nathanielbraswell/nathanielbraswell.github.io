About Me
======

I am an undergraduate cognitive scientist and researcher currently studying perception, consciousness, and imagination. I currently serve in research positions under Felipe de Brigard at the Duke University [Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab](https://www.imclab.org/){:target="\_blank"}, Chaz Firestone at the [Hopkins Perception and Mind Lab](https://perception.jhu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, and Megan Zirnstein at the Pomona College Bilingualism and Cognition Lab. In previous years, I have held research positions in Claremont McKenna College's philosophy and finance programs, and last summer I did some thrilling work on implicit jury bias for Harvard Law School's empirically-oriented [Access 2 Justice Lab](https://a2jlab.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am currently working toward my BA in Cognitive Science with a concentration in Philosophy and Neuroscience at Claremont McKenna College, where I complete my program through the [Department of Linguistics and Cognitive Science](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/linguistics-cognitive-science){:target="\_blank"} at Pomona College. My current research interests combine approaches from philosophy, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to answer questions about the nature of unconscious perception, constancy mechanisms, and cognitive penetration. My other research interests include language, emotion, intelligence, and neuroaesthetics. With an ambition to position interdisciplinary work as the centerpiece of my research career, my top priorities are cultivating rigorous philosophical discourse, applying  relevant and precise experimental methods, and gaining proficiency in computational and neuroscientific techniques.

Other Interests
======
When not performing research, I serve as a teaching assistant in Pomona College's cognitive neuroscience program and as a regular writer for the Claremont Colleges' [philosophy journal](https://tabularasaclaremont.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I also obsess over solving Rubik's cubes and showing off photoshoots of my pet hedgehog, [Alfredo](https://nathanielbraswell.github.io/Alfredo/){:target="\_blank"}.
